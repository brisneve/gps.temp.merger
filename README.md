# GPS and Temperature Data Merger

## Introduction

The package serves as a tool to merge data gathered from two different sources: GPS tracking via a mobile app that tracks the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the sampling location, and water temperature logging through the [HOBO Water Temperature Pro v2 Data Logger](https://www.onsetcomp.com/products/data-loggers/u22-001) that records water temperature readings at specific intervals.

Both the GPS tracker and the water temperature logger are deployed simultaneously during field sampling. This ensures that data from both sources correspond to the same time frame and location. The GPS tracker continuously logs the coordinates of the sampling location as the mobile device moves. Meanwhile, the water temperature logger periodically records water temperature data.

The package contains a function designed to merge the GPS data and water temperature data. Merging is done based on the timestamps associated with each set of measurements. Since both devices are deployed concurrently, their timestamps align, allowing for accurate synchronization. By matching the timestamps, the package pairs the GPS coordinates with the corresponding water temperature readings, creating a unified dataset. The merged dataset provides a comprehensive view of both spatial (GPS) and environmental (water temperature) parameters at the sampled locations.

Moreover, this package contains a function to map the merged GPS and water temperature data. The mapping function serves as a visualization tool, allowing users to plot the merged GPS coordinates along with corresponding water temperature data onto a map interface.

## Installation

To install and load this package, you can use the following codes:

| path_temp   | This argument represents the file path to the .csv file containing temperature data collected from the HOBO Water Temperature Pro v2 Data Logger. It serves as a pointer to the location where the temperature data obtained from the logger is stored. This data typically includes recorded temperature readings at various time intervals. |
| path_gps    | This argument denotes the file path to the .txt file containing GPS data obtained from the mobile app GPS tracker. It specifies the location of the text file that holds the GPS data captured by the mobile app GPS tracker. This data comprises latitude and longitude coordinates recorded during field sampling.                          |
| output_path | This argument signifies the file path where the merged dataset will be saved as a .csv file. It indicates the directory and file name under which the merged dataset, combining GPS and temperature data, will be stored.                                                                                                                     |
| merged_data | This argument refers to the data frame generated by the `merge_gps_temp()` function, containing the merged GPS and temperature data. It represents the structured data object resulting from the merging process, where GPS coordinates and temperature readings are combined into a unified dataset.                                         |

## Example

``` r
path_temp <- "data/temp_logger_data.csv"
path_gps <- "data/gps_tracker_data.txt"

df <- merge_gps_temp(path_temp, path_gps, output_path = NULL)

head(df)

mpa_gps_temp(df)
```
